# Real time traffic signs detection & classification
A Project for Applications of Deep Learning using Neural Network.

# About
In this project I have proposed a solution for vehicle drivers and made a traffic sign recognizer which can inform the drivers about the traffic sign coming ahead. This project helps to reduce road accidents.
