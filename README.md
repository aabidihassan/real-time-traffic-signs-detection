# Real time traffic signs detection & classification
A Project for Applications of Deep Learning using Neural Network.

# About
In this project I have proposed a solution for vehicle drivers and made a traffic sign recognizer which can inform the drivers about the traffic sign coming ahead. This project helps to reduce road accidents.

# Setup and Requirements
Python== 3.7

Keras== 2.4.3

Tensorflow== 2.4.1

OpenCv== 4.5.1.48

Sklearn== 0.24.2

Pandas== 1.3.1

Numpy== 1.19.5

Matplotlib== 3.4.3

Seaborn== 0.11.1

# Dataset
I have used the “German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark” (GTSRB) dataset.

Dataset contains 43 classes with 39,209 total images.
